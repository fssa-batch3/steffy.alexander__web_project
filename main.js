Apart from The Dumb Cane, the decorative plant is also known as the mother-in-law tongue (i.e., the common name used for Sansevieria). This is because, the plant has a toxic sap with calcium oxalate crystals, which once ingested causes tongue and throat inflammation leading to temporary inability to speak. Dieffenbachia or the “dumb cane plant” varieties range from small dwarf types to the large dark green mottled foliage. This plant can thrive for years indoors and reach up to 4 to 5 feet as an attractive floor plant.",
